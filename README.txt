
INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

- To be able to run the code, Python 3.5+ should be installed. 

- The openAI gym library should be installed. To install it, the following command can be used:
  pip install gym

- The tabulate library should also be installed in order to print the results, use the following command:
  pip install tabulate

- the environment cannot be properly displayed on the command line, so running it on any python IDE is ideal (however no errors will occur if run on command line)

- ensure that all the python scripts provided are present in the same directory.

- run the main.py file

- the taxi.py file was obtained from the openAI gym, and minor changes were made to the file in order to change the environment.
